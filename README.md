# Zetl

An extension for Google Chrome that allows the user to save, retrieve, edit and
delete notes about web pages. Much like bookmarks, only potentially more
verbose and informative. Notes can also be manipulated while offline.

Simply click the Zetl icon next to Chrome's search bar at the top of the
screen. A popup will appear which provides access to all of Zetl's features.

## Installation

First clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/pnoom/zetl
```

Then run Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions`, ensure that the "Developer
Mode" box is ticked, and click "Load unpacked extension". Select the zetl
directory, click ok, and you're good to go.
